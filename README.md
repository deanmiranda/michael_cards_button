# Card Component with Overlay Interaction

## Overview

This component displays a series of cards with interactive overlays that reveal additional information upon hover or focus. Each card is equipped with a dynamic background effect that activates on hover and focus states. Additionally, links inside the cards are fully accessible, ensuring that they can be tabbed into without being obstructed by the overlay.

## Standards and Requirements

- **Accessibility (ADA Compliant)**: Each card has a `role="button"` and `aria-label` for accessibility. Links within the cards are tabbable and interactable via keyboard.
- **CSS Grid Layout**: The layout uses CSS Grid to handle responsive behavior, displaying 3 cards per row on desktop, 2 cards on tablet, and 1 card per row on mobile.
- **JavaScript Interaction**: Card focus and hover interactions are controlled via JavaScript, ensuring that when the card or links inside it are focused, the overlay doesn’t block the content.
- **CSS Transitions**: Smooth transitions are applied to both the overlay’s background gradient and the slide-up effect for accessibility and visual fluidity.
- **Modular and Reusable**: The design and behavior are flexible, enabling the component to be used in various contexts with minimal configuration.

## Browser Testing and Responsiveness

- **Browsers**: Tested in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) for compatibility.
- **Mobile/Responsive Design**: Fully responsive, adjusting layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop views, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.

## Dependencies

- No external libraries required.
